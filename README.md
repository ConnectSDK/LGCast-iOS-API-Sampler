LG Cast is an additional feature provided by Connect SDK's WebOS TV Service.

## Screen Mirroring
With Connect SDK integrated in the mobile app, it can cast the screen and sound into the TV screen. 
This allows you to extend the screen of a mobile app to a larger TV screen and share it with your family.

## Remote Camera
With Connect SDK integrated in the mobile app, it can display camera preview on the TV screen. 
This allows you to use your mobile device’s camera as a remote camera for the TV that does not have an internal or USB camera.
